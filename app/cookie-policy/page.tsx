            This Cookie Policy explains how PawFinder ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies to
            recognize you when you visit our website and use our services. It explains what these technologies are and
            why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">What Are Cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
            Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well
            as to provide reporting information.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, PawFinder) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by
            parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable
            third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising,
            interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your
            computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical
            reasons in order for our website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary"
            cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the
            experience on our website and services. Third parties serve cookies through our website for advertising,
            analytics, and other purposes.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
          <p>
            The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our website and the purposes they perform
            are described below:
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Essential Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our website and to use
            some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to
            deliver the website, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our website functions.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 my-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Session Cookies:</strong> These cookies are temporary and expire once you close your browser. They
              are used to keep you logged in as you navigate through our site.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Security Cookies:</strong> These cookies help identify and prevent security risks. They may be
              used to store your security preferences or to prevent malicious activity.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Performance and Functionality Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our website but are non-essential to
            their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 my-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Preference Cookies:</strong> These cookies remember your preferences and settings to enhance your
              experience (e.g., language preferences, location settings).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Functionality Cookies:</strong> These cookies help our website remember choices you make (such as
              your username, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Analytics and Customization Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our
            website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our website for
            you.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 my-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics to collect information about how visitors use
              our site. These cookies collect information in an anonymous form, including the number of visitors to the
              site, where visitors have come to the site from, and the pages they visited.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hotjar:</strong> We use Hotjar to better understand our users' needs and to optimize this service
              and experience. Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users' experience
              (e.g., how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don't
              like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Advertising Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like
            preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some
            cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 my-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Facebook Pixel:</strong> We use the Facebook Pixel to deliver targeted advertisements to users who
              have visited our website when they are on Facebook or other platforms operated by Facebook.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Google Ads:</strong> We use Google Ads cookies to track conversions and to retarget users with
              advertisements across the Google advertising network.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar
            technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These
            are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has
            visited our website or opened an email that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the
            traffic patterns of users from one page within our website to another, to deliver or communicate with
            cookies, to understand whether you have come to our website from an online advertisement displayed on a
            third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns.
            In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies
            will impair their functioning.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">How Can You Control Cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences
            by clicking on the appropriate opt-out links provided in the cookie table above.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject
            cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may
            be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from
            browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.
          </p>
